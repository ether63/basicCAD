## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

This is how you will write image code for INTERNALLY STORED images on your repo.   just FYI.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

### Reflection
i was stuck on the holes like how to do the linear pattern but i think by watching video is the easy way to finsih your work because it give you all the tip you need but watch the video close so you don't mass it up

## Fork

### Description
This is a fork with it have a extrude of 8mm blide of the face of the sketch and 75mm extrude of cylinders and it also have  fillet 1 has 15mm,fillet 2 has 1mm and fillet 3 has 4mm

### Reflection
This one uas hard because you have to do the mirror and the fillet but by watching the video it give me a tip on how to do it I think a good tip is just to watch the video because it show you how to do it.
