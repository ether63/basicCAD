## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Evidence

This is how you will write image code for INTERNALLY STORED images on your repo.   just FYI.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
this is a 120mm square with 10mm holes in each corener and a 25mm hole in the center

### Evidence
[The Mount in Onshape](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/43b35685c6a0fd500f61b3b5/w/7cce22bc1be18a4985224dcd/e/08ed232e0cbb946cdd8c4683)

### Reflection
i was stuck on the holes like how to do the linear pattern but i think by watching video is the easy way to finsih your work because it give you all the tip you need but watch the video close so you don't mass it up

## Fork

### Description
This is a fork with it have a extrude of 8mm blide of the face of the sketch and 75mm extrude of cylinders and it also have  fillet 1 has 15mm,fillet 2 has 1mm and fillet 3 has 4mm

### Evidence

### Reflection
This one uas hard because you have to do the mirror and the fillet but by watching the video it give me a tip on how to do it I think a good tip is just to watch the video because it show you how to do it.

## Tire

### Description
So This is a Tire you have to drew different line and dimension to make it until the line is black  than you have to revolve it and just fillet the edge by 8mm

### Reflection
This one is very hard because you have to drew a lot of line and dimension a lot of line  But the rest was easy a good tip is just don't rush it because you will mass it up you have to do it slowly so you can get every detail of it
---


## Wheel

### Description
The wheel is kind of the same as the tire but this you have to add the circular pattern and put a bearing of 5mm extrude

### Evidence
[This wheels in onshape](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/43b35685c6a0fd500f61b3b5/w/7cce22bc1be18a4985224dcd/e/716e558c848cd8b5ef53c174)

### Reflection
The wheel is hard because i never got this far last year and it was like new to me but i manage to get it done because of the video the video is very helpful you should watched the video it is the easy way to finsih it fast

## AxleCollarBearings

### Description
for the Axle  is a 2 circle of 10 and 6mm diameter and for the collar it a 15mm diameter you have to extrude the collar by 10mm and extrude the axle by 60mm and for the bearing is a 2 circle of 20 and 30mm of diameter and extrude it by 5mm

### Evidence
[The Axle and collar in onshape](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/43b35685c6a0fd500f61b3b5/w/7cce22bc1be18a4985224dcd/e/8c6c12750b70c6d3698cd9a)

### Reflection
This was easy i don't have any problem but a good tip is to take your time and watched the video
